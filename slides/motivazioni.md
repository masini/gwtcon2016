##  Motivating forces

We need
 
* A programming model that can lower the barrier of using GWT as the GUI framework...
* ..helped by an archetype for fast startup of new enterprise application project

Note:

We started using GWT 10 years ago and from the beginning we thought that for a real enterprise
use would be necessary tools not avaiable in the standard toolkit at that time.
Among this we identified a standard layout for all our internal applications, a simplified development
model and an archetype to start project coherently and in few minutes

Since then 10 years have passed and yet these ingredients are not part of the standard toolkit
nor any framework available on the open source landscape
