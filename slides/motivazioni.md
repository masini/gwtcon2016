##  Motivazioni

We needed an archetype to lower the startup time of new enterprise application, and a programming model that can lower the barrier of using GWT as the GUI framework.

Our targets

* A coherent layout
* Integration with an external provisioning system 
* Simplified REST call
* GWT Widgets that let the developer ignore the underlying HTML5/CSS

This was done gluing together some carefully choosen available frameworks.
