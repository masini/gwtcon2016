Note:

We tried to use AngularJS in a simple application to understand better if can be a good enterprise candidate.

The response was that it isn't, the developer must write a lot of XXX-Script to make what we did in the Java code showed before.
HTML5/CSS3 must be written for the user interface (and automatic two-way databinding is a cool feature).

Not a good candidate for enterprise applications.
