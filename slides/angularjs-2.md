Note:

We tried to use AngularJS in a simple application to understand better if can be a good enterprise candidate.

The response was that it isn't, the developer must do a lot of scripting to make what we did in few lines of Java code showed before.
HTML5/CSS3 must be written for the user interface 

Automatic two-way databinding is a cool feature but not enough for a choice of a framework.

In our opinion is not a good candidate for enterprise applications.
