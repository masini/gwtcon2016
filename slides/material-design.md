###  Material Design

<img src="resources/ticcru.png"/>

Note:

Here is an example of our layout, done with Material Design in mind.

You can notice the menu on the left, which can be opened/closed using the burger icon in the top-left corner of the header bar.

You can show the current logged user or if you prefer the company logo, there also a information icon that will be discussed later on

The header bar can include a search bar and the application title

Finally the content panel, which in this example include a GWT DataGrid that uses GWT-Material styles.

Here we can note icons in the generated menu, and among other widgets in the content panel a collapsible, 
very useful if you want to include some controls.
 
Here we have material buttons and material list box
  
Below two datagrids that show the results

Interesting to note that this web application not only is responsive and usable on device with various screen sizes,
but is also touch ready, so can be used in kiosk available to internal users and customers
