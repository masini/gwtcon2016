Note:

Here is an example of our layout, done with Material Design in mind.

You can notice the menu on the right, which can be opened/closed using the burger icon in the top-left corner of the header bar.

You can show the current logged user or if you prefer the company logo, there also a information icon that will be discussed later on

The header bar can include a search bar and the application title

Finally the content panel, which in this example include a GWT DataGrid that uses GWT-Material styles.
