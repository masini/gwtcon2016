##  Tech choices

* GWT 2.8 (of course)
* GWT Material 1.6 (soon 2.0)
* Errai Framework 4


Note: 

Going back to our technological choice for the new version of our framework (version 4), we opted out for GWT 2.8, starting with the beta version passing 
among release candidates and now we have a final version.

We used version 1.6 of gwt-material, still version 2.0 is not production ready

Errai 4 Beta was used from the beginning, continuing the road of the previous versions of productive which started from Errai 2.

We decided for two non final products (GWT now final and Errai) because we didn't want to deliver something with yet a 
technical debt.
