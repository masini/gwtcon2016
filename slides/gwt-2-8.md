##  GWT 2.8

* Java 8 is cool but....

    * 2.8 compile time is higher than in 2.7 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    * More memory usage (+80%) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    * Variables name now are even more cryptically and still no support from Source Maps <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
