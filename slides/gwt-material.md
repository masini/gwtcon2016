##  GWT Material

* Chosen because it's ready to use in production now
* No Google's Material Design Light, we want GWT Widgets and few CSS3/HTML5 (distraction free coding)                                            
* We are interested observers of gwt-polymer project...
* ...and the brand new GXT5

Note:

GWT Material version 1.6 is ready to use in production, it has some issues, but no one really blocking. 
Still also you need to use the original GWT DataGrid but styles for it are bundled and we can survive.

We decided not to use MDL, we don't use HTML5/CSS3 for our views so we would need to create wrapper for every widget,
too much work

Finally we are observing Vaadin's gwt-polymer project, we think that can be an interesting evolution for 
GWT Widgets generated directly from Web Components, more future proof than using GWT-Material. This is something we will
evaluate in the medium term.
