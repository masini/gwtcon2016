##  ReactJS

It took 20 years to escape from JSP and ASP.

Now Facebook has invented JSX, so that we can mix JavaScript and HTML:
```JavaScript
class App extends React.Component {
   render() {

      var i = 1;

      return (
         <div>
            <h1>{i == 1 ? 'True!' : 'False'}</h1>
         </div>
      );
   }
}
```
But Flux is very interesting !!!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
