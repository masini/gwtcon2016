##  ReactJS

It took 20 years to escape from JSP and ASP.

Now Facebook has invented JSX, so that we can mix JavaScript and HTML:
```JavaScript
class App extends React.Component {
   render() {

      var i = 1;

      return (
         <div>
            <h1>{i == 1 ? 'True!' : 'False'}</h1>
         </div>
      );
   }
}
```
But Flux is very interesting !!!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:
Well, ReactJS now is the coolest framework but......

A lot has been said and written against JSP and ASP because they mix HTML tags with Java/JavaScript/C# code and now what ??

A new framework that let us mix HTML and JavaScript.

Seriously ?

But I recommend you to have a look at their design pattern, Flux, is very interesting.
