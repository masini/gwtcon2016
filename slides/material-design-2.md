Note:

Here we can note icons in the generated menu, and among other widgets in the content panel a collapsible, 
very useful if you want to include some controls.

Below two celltable that show the results

Interesting to note that this web application not only is responsive and usable on device with various screen sizes,
but is also touch ready, so can be used in kiosk available to internal users and customers
